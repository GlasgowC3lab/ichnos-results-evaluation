analyzing CPU 0: driver: intel_cpufreq CPUs which run at the same hardware frequency: 0 CPUs which need to have their frequency coordinated by software: 0 maximum transition latency: 20.0 us hardware limits: 1.20 GHz - 2.50 GHz available cpufreq governors: conservative ondemand userspace powersave performance schedutil current policy: frequency should be within 1.20 GHz and 2.50 GHz. The governor "performance" may decide which speed to use within this range. current CPU frequency: Unable to call hardware current CPU frequency: 2.16 GHz (asserted by call to kernel) boost state support: Supported: yes Active: yes 25500 MHz max turbo 4 active cores 25500 MHz max turbo 3 active cores 25500 MHz max turbo 2 active cores 25500 MHz max turbo 1 active cores
