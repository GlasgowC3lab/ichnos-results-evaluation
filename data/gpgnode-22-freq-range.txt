analyzing CPU 0: driver: intel_pstate CPUs which run at the same hardware frequency: 0 CPUs which need to have their frequency coordinated by software: 0 maximum transition latency: Cannot determine or is not supported. hardware limits: 800 MHz - 4.10 GHz available cpufreq governors: performance powersave current policy: frequency should be within 800 MHz and 4.10 GHz. The governor "performance" may decide which speed to use within this range. current CPU frequency: Unable to call hardware current CPU frequency: 4.09 GHz (asserted by call to kernel) boost state support: Supported: yes Active: yes
